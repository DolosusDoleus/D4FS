Bearskie, feel free to change any of this if you feel it could be clearer, worded better, or expanded upon.

#Basic Information

-The "Story" & Theme-
Dwarf Fortress From Scratch III is set on a magical plane of existence. Everything is touched by magic in some way, from the stone of the earth, to the vermin who walk upon it, to even the weather above. This plane is still blessed by the hands of the Gods, who continue to mold and shape it. Having recently come under siege by creatures, abominations, who walk the spaces between planes, some of the inhabitants have taken up the path of technology to battle them back, while others continue to turn to magic.

The invading creatures represent the chaotic nature of magic, and the wilder creations of some of the "Gods," while the original inhabitants are of a more orderly magic variety.

#Important information regarding creatures and materials#

In an attempt to make reactions, syndromes, interactions, etc, more standardized and structured, it's been decided to have a more standardized set of creature classes. It's also been recommended to add reaction classes to materials so we can target them more easily(I've placed mine at the bottom of my templates).

There is a creature class list attached for you to look through, and use any classes that fit on your creature.
