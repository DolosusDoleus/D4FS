Who dares to enter my house?  I curse you!
You dare to defile my property? Death will soon come to you adventurer
you have trespassed. you will die.
Trespasser, I will kill you like the tomb-rat you are.
Die, Trespasser.
You have trespassed. A curse is upon you now.
You have awakened me. You will pay.
