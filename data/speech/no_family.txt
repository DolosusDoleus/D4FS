I have no family to speak of
I have none that I call family
They got killed by a dragon
Most of them were killed by a cave-in
Hmmm... It has been a while since our last reunion. wonder if they're still alive?
I do not wish to talk about them
My mother-in-law is a vampire
My father-in-law is a were-sloth
My daughter is a necromancer
My son is a zombie
My grandfather is a mummy
My grandmother is the queen of The Lying Cakes
My wife is dead, killed by a adventurer. say, you aren't a adventurer, are you?
