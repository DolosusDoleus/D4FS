# Dwarf 4tress From Scratch
Dwarf 4tress From Scratch (pronounced like 'Dwarf Fortress From Scratch') is the fourth iteration of the community Bay12Forums project, 'Dwarf Fortress From Scratch', based on the video game 'Slaves to Armok: God of Blood - Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress', or, as more commonly known, 'Dwarf Fortress'.

If you are unfamiliar with the game, you may download it [here][1]. After that, you may partake in this project by first registering on the [official forums][2]. This is, of course, not a hard prerequisite -- however, we would like to know who is developing for the project.

This project is a mixture of a [modding project](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Modding_guide) and a standard playthrough of the game. The participants are divided into two groups, Players and Modders (though worry not; these groups are not mutually exclusive nor binding -- you may join the other group at any time). 

The Players simply download the current version of the master branch of this mod, and play it. They then write about the happenings in their game, about what they found interesting, if they found bugs, or anything, really. They may also post screenshots alongside the story.
Again, please note that is not a hard prerequisite. You may enjoy the game without our knowledge, too, obviously.

The Modders, on the other hand, add more to the project by creating new creatures, stones, buildings, items, etc. It is beneficial for them to know about basic Git(hub) usage, however it is not required. If they had created something, but cannot use Git(hub), they may ask [Cerapter](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=107094) on the Bay12Forums, [LordCerapter](https://github.com/LordCerapter) on GitHub (both being the same person), or any modders currently participating in the project, and they will upload in their stead.

Navigate to the project's thread [with this link][2].

## Players' Guide
(This guide assumes you can download files, unpackage packaged files, launching executables, and can do basic file modifications, such as copying, pasting, and deleting.)

1. Obtain the [game][1].
2. Download the Project's latest version from the [master branch](https://github.com/LordCerapter/D4FS/archive/master.zip).
3. Back up the game's original files.
4. In the game's files, remove the `data` and the `raw` folders.
5. Move, or copy and paste the downloaded Project's `data` and `raw` folders into the game's folder, where the original folders used to be.
  + Now, the game will use the project's files.
6. Launch the game.
Additionally:
7. Your game will generate a file in the same folder as your executable, called `errorlog.txt`. Post its contents on the forums.
  + Please note that it does not empty itself, meaning that errors from previous playthroughs will still be in there when you start a new game. You may manually erase the errors you have already posted on the forums.
  + If this file does not appear, then we have made a version without errors. Do not worry about it, then.
